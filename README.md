## About Me
I'm a Mathematics and Data Science student at Truman State University, minoring in Statistics, Computer Science, and Astronomy. I'm pursuing a career in data analytics and have experience with statistical analysis, data wrangling and visualization, machine learning, and programming using R, Python, C++, and Java.

> #### Part 1: Critique
> Individually, the representations of the individual variables work well. The sizes of the circles
are useful for comparing land area, and are scaled correctly. The lines are also helpful for
comparing population and tax revenue for each country. The diagonal lines connecting the
vertical lines help the viewer see each as a group, and guides the eye to make the comparison
between the two for each country. Having the lines be different colors helps distinguish them
from each other as well.
However, there is simply too much going on in the visualization for it to be as effective as
it could. The complex shapes and lines look nice but make it harder to figure out what the
visualization is trying to communicate. The lack of labeling is confusing as well, since you
cannot tell right away what the different lines or colors mean (for example the population vs
tax revenue line, or why the circles are different colors).
In the end, with some work from the viewer, you can understand what the graph wants to
communicate. However, it is not immediately obvious, so the graph does not communicate it
well. It most obviously shows the comparisons of land areas, and with a bit of digging you
can see the population and tax revenue comparison.
